abstract: This study investigated relay-assisted mode 1 sidelink (SL) multicast
  transmission, which encounters interference from mode 2 SL transmission, for
  use in low-latency vehicle-to-everything communications. To accommodate mode
  1--mode 2 SL traffic, we use the hybrid multiple access (MA) approach, which
  combines orthogonal MA (OMA) and nonorthogonal MA (NOMA) schemes. We introduce
  a low-complexity location-based hybrid MA algorithm and its associated relay
  selection that can be used when SL channel state information is unavailable.
