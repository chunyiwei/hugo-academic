abstract: The device‐to‐device (D2D) communication technology is one of the most
  significant evolutionary development of the LTE system. It introduces the new
  defined physical‐layer sidelink channel for the direct transmission between
  terminal devices, apart from the traditional base station‐assisted data
  transmission. The service and business opportunities motivated by the D2D
  communication technique are rapidly growing. In Rel‐12 of LTE system, the
  development of D2D is initiated by supporting the public‐safety application
  and proximity‐based service for commercial use. In Rel‐14, LTE has the
  ambition of supporting vehicular communication through the sidelink channel.
  It becomes one of the essential services and applications of sidelink
  communication technology. The sidelink technology has also been rapidly
  evolved with the new radio (NR) framework of 5G defined in Rel‐15. Atop of 5G
  NR technology, the standard of NR vehicle‐to‐everything (V2X) is under the
  normative work of the Rel‐16 LTE standardization. In this article, we
  introduce the fundamental physical‐layer design of D2D communication
  standardized for the LTE system. Additionally, we provide our views on the
  challenges and opportunities of NR sidelink in the physical layer. The
  low‐altitude unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) is another potential application
  that will benefit from the sidelink communication technology. Along with the
  evolution of the next‐generation mobile technology, the sidelink will play a
  more vital role and introduce more business and research opportunities than
  before.
