abstract: Device-to-device (D2D) communication, an emerging form of wireless
  communication, has attracted considerable attention, but an efficient
  synchronization protocol has not yet been developed. This has crucial
  implications for public safety applications, which lack sufficient network
  infrastructure. In the public safety applications, the cellular network may
  not be available or fully functional when the base stations are malfunctioned
  or destroyed due to disasters, such as an earthquake, a tsunami or an attack,
  etc. One of the major features of D2D is to provide a self-organized
  communication network for the emergency use. In this paper, we develop a
  synchronization protocol to assist mobile devices in a target area in
  establishing a synchronized network for public safety applications. The
  signal-to-interferenceplus- noise ratio (SINR)-based synchronization protocol
  proposed accounts for the dynamic physical layer reception effect, and its
  algorithm can efficiently designate D2D devices to assist in forwarding timing
  signals, thereby enhancing the coverage of the synchronous network. More
  importantly, our synchronization protocol and its algorithm may assist D2D
  devices in dynamically changing their state to adapt to the variant wireless
  channel conditions and dynamic topology of the network. In the simulation
  results, we show that the proposed synchronization protocol enabled more than
  90% of D2D devices to successfully synchronize with the network, whereas only
  75% of D2D devices successfully synchronized with the network through the
  legacy synchronization protocol.
