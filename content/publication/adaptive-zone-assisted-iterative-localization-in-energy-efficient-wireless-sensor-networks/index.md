abstract: In the public safety-related applications which use wireless sensor
  networks (WSNs) to estimate a target’s location, identifying the most
  effective search zone in which the target is located can reduce computational
  complexity and shorten the response time. We formulated a threshold- based
  scheme that only uses binary reports from sensors to identify the most
  effective search zone. This scheme requires no a priori information regarding
  statistics on the sensor’s decision preference. Based on this scheme, we
  developed an adaptive zone–assisted iterative localization (AZ-IL) scheme.
  Compared with existing iterative localization schemes, our scheme can reduce
  the computational complexity of localization processes and maintain the
  localization performance in energy-efficient WSNs, in which some sensors are
  placed in sleep mode.
